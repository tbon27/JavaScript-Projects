### Welcome to my JavaScript Tic-Tac-Toe repository!

The purpose of this repository is to store my project files for the Tic-Tac-Toe project.

- The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first, and then users are off playing the classic game. The winner is celebrated with a win audio clip, and ties result in an alternative audio clip. This is a Mortal Kombat themed tic-tac-toe game.
