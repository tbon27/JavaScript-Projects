## Here are some small projects that I made using JavaScript

- [Pizza Menu](JavaScript-Projects//Pizza_Project/Pizza.html)
- [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](JavaScript-Projects/TicTacToe/TicTacToe.html)
- [Calculator](JavaScript-Projects/Calculator/calculator.html)

## Pizza Menu

#### This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

#### The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first, and then users are off playing the classic game. The winner is celebrated with a win audio clip, and ties result in an alternative audio clip. This is a Mortal Kombat themed tic-tac-toe game.

## Calculator

#### A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
